# Basketball-Game

Project created to learn program the basic trajectory of an object (in this case a ball).
A simple script calculates a prerendered object projection line (simulation) which is calculated in real time and shown on the screen.

#### For a better visual effect, a few additions have been added:
- simple UI
- simple models of ball, basket and environment with texturing
- simple particle effects
- soundtracking the scenery and the UI buttons
- adding the best score board and a simple game of throwing the ball into the basket on time
- simple tutorial in the form of picture instruction
- screen shaking effect when shooting at the basket


#### Possible additional functionality and future improvements:
- FPS improvement, with more objects (balls) the game can slightly lose frames 
- Better simulation of the ball flight and its reaction with the environment (currently seems incorrect)
- Increased control over the throwing of the ball (e.g., ball hitting force, slightly changing the location of the throw)
